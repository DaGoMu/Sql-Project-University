Project Requirements for SQL Course

Project Overview
Build a SQL database for a university that manages students, courses, professors, and grades.

Project Technical Requirements

The project needs to contain the following technical features:
    • Build a database with the following tables: Students, Courses, Professors, Grades
    • Foreign key relationships between the tables
    • Create a script that populates all of the database tables with sample data
    • SQL query scripts for:
        ◦ The average grade that is given by each professor
        ◦ The top grades for each student
        ◦ Sort students by the courses that they are enrolled in
        ◦ Create a summary report of courses and their average grades, sorted by the most challenging course (course with the lowest average grade) to the easiest course
        ◦ Finding which student and professor have the most courses in common

Submission options: Push all scripts to a single Github repo and submit the link to repo on this page. If you're not familiar with Github, create a separate gist for all of the scripts and submit the gist on this page.
